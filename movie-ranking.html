<h1>The Best Movies According to Abena</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>I Believe</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. This is about a 9-year-old boy who experienced God's power in a supernatural way. As a result, his family and other unbelievers had an encounter with God in a wonderful way and turned to Him.</p>

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>Really interesting movie about 3 guys. Funny but educative.</p>

<h3>Miss Perfect</h3>
<p>An interesting movie about a lady who had a hard time accepting her father because he abandoned her and the mother for over 20 years. However, she faced a similar situation as her father, after breaking up with her ex and marrying a man with a delinquent daughter. Interestingly, she trained the daughter to be become a better person and they became a great family.</p>
